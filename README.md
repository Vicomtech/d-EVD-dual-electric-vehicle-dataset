# d-EVD_dual-Electric-Vehicle-Dataset
This is a dual dataset of electric vehicle trips where battery, driving conditions and external conditions data is obtained. Electric car owners have the uncertainty of the battery range. The purpose of these datasets is to train models for an accurate battery range prediction.

It is dual because there are two different dataset. One is formed with synthetic data from a wide range of simulations (DEVST), and the other are real trips carried out with two different vehicles (DEVRT).

In the next sections, the content and the way to access to the datasets is explained.
