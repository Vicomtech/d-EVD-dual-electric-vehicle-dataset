# d-EVD_dual-Electric-Vehicle-Dataset
This is a dual dataset of electric vehicle trips where battery, driving conditions and external conditions data is obtained. Electric car owners have the uncertainty of the battery range. The purpose of these datasets is to train models for an accurate battery range prediction.

It is dual because there are two different dataset. One is formed with synthetic data from a wide range of simulations (DEVST), and the other are real trips carried out with two different vehicles (DEVRT).

In the next sections, the content and the way to access to the datasets is explained.


## DEVST (Dataset of Electric Vehicle Synthetic Trips)

Simulations have been done using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) software. Data consists of 21 different routes and for each route, 5 cars, 3 driving styles, 3 confort cases, 5 occupancy cases, 3 wind cases and 3 traffic situations have been combined. The cases are the following:

* Driving style: agressive, moderate, defensive.
* Confort: high, medium, low.
* Occupancy: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
* Traffic: high, medium, low.
* Wind: high, medium, low.

This combination gives a total of 42525 trips.
